## Verifier

Verifier is a Java library responsible for performing FPGA attestation.
It is able to retrieve measurements (evidence) from the FPGA device and compare it with Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (.corim).
It also retrieves and validates signature and chain of certificates to confirm authenticity and integrity of the
measurements.

Concise Reference Integrity Manifest can be generated using Quartus and stored in Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (.corim) format.

Workload is a sample application that triggers Verifier's interface.

During attestation, communication is done via Hard Processor System (HPS), thus a listening TCP server called
FCS Server must be enabled on HPS.

After FCS Server is up and running, note down the #HOST# (hostname or ip address of HPS) and #PORT# (of FCS Server).

## Supported platforms and protocols

Verifier supports Altera Agilex and eASIC N5X devices.

Verifier support [TCG DICE](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/dice-architectures/)
with [DMTF SPDM](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/SPDM) protocol for Altera Agilex and eASIC N5X devices
using [libspdm](https://github.com/DMTF/libspdm) library.

## Prerequisites

1. Java 17

2. FCS Server should be up and running on HPS, with TCP traffic
   enabled

3. Configure network for outgoing communication on port 443 (HTTPS) and TCP communication to #HOST#:#PORT# of the FCS
   Server

4. Prepare Product Owner Root Signing Key (`root_private.pem`), chain (`root.qky`) and `quartus_sign` tool must be
   available to be used during initialization step.

5. (Recommended) Set up Java Cryptography
   Extension ([JCE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-cryptography-architecture-jca-reference-guide.html))
   Provider of your choice (Gemalto Luna SA HSM, nCipher etc.)
   (Default) Alternatively, built-in BouncyCastle ([link](https://bouncycastle.org/)
   and [repository](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java)) library can be used with no additional configuration

6. Generate Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (.corim) file for your board design using `quartus_pfg` tool

   `quartus_pfg -c <design.rbf> <output.corim>`

## Quick setup

#### Build and configure SPDM Wrapper
To build spdm_wrapper, go to [spdm_wrapper/README.md](../spdm_wrapper/README.md)
#### Building Verifier
Build and deploy project using gradle:

    ../gradlew clean build deploy

> **WARNING**
> Task **_deploy_** will overwrite the content of **out/** directory.

In command line set strong password to security provider in environment variable **env:
VERIFIER_SECURITY_PROVIDER_PASSWORD**

    export VERIFIER_SECURITY_PROVIDER_PASSWORD=

Output libraries are located under **out/** directory together with Verifier's config file `config.properties`.

### First run

Run workload sample application (which is a fat jar already containing the Verifier lib) with basic arguments

    java -jar ./out/workload.jar -i "" -c HEALTH

The output during first run shall be the instruction how to configure the library with chosen security provider.
Edit the `config.properties` and use `quartus_sign` tool with private key `root_private.pem` and chain `root_chain.qky`
to sign the pubkey and complete the _first run_ process.

> **WARNING**
> By default BouncyCastle security provider is used. It creates a file in /tmp directory. This /tmp directory might be
> cleaned after machine reboot.
> Edit `security-provider-params.security.input-stream-param` in `config.properties` to change this directory.
> For enhanced security it is recommended to use a stronger security provider.

> **Note**
>
> This is only one-time operation.
> Clear the `verifier-key-params.key-name` parameter from `config.properties` in case
> it has to be repeated or a new Signing Key must be created.

### Run

After the library with security provider is configured run the workload sample app again, this time providing #HOST# and
#PORT# of the FCS Server running on HPS.

#### Run HEALTH check

The command will verify the connection and return the device id (chip id) of FPGA

    java -jar ./out/workload.jar -i "host:#HOST#; port:#PORT#" -c HEALTH

e.g.,

    java -jar ./out/workload.jar -i "host:localhost; port:50001" -c HEALTH

#### Get device attestation

Provide #PATH# to generated .corim file:

    java -jar ./out/workload.jar -i “host:#HOST#; port:#PORT#” -c GET --ref-measurement #PATH#

e.g.,

    java -jar ./out/workload.jar -i “host:localhost; port:50001” -c GET --ref-measurement ./design.corim

### Security provider

Verifier uses an EC 384 private key which must be protected in a security provider.
Security provider is a choice of the user, however it must implement Java Cryptography
Extension ([JCE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-cryptography-architecture-jca-reference-guide.html))
interface.

#### Built-in BouncyCastle

By default, built-in file-based BouncyCastle library is used.
It creates a file in location specified in `config.properties`
under `security-provider-params.security.input-stream-param` parameter.
The file is encrypted with the master key specified by user:

1. (recommended) either in environment variable **env:VERIFIER_SECURITY_PROVIDER_PASSWORD**
2. or in `config.properties` under `security-provider-params.security.password`

Other settings under `security-provider-params` are already filled in and are specific to BouncyCastle.

#### Other providers

For other providers, user must provide a path to the provider's jar to application classpath and
update `config.properties`
with values specific for that provider.

Run the below command providing path to provider's jar:

**Linux**

    java -cp workload.jar:[PATH_TO_PROVIDER_JAR] com.intel.bkp.workload.WorkloadApp ...

**Windows**

    java -cp [PATH_TO_PROVIDER_JAR];workload.jar com.intel.bkp.workload.WorkloadApp ...

**Example**

    java -cp workload.jar:/opt/libs-ext/OtherSecurityProvider.jar com.intel.bkp.workload.WorkloadApp -i "host:localhost; port:50001" -c HEALTH

## Integrate as a library

Verifier can also be integrated in User’s sample workload application.
To do this, invoke a below command providing path to the library jar
file. The Workload from **out/** directory is not used in this case.
Verifier API is described in Attestation Software Architecture
Specification (SAS) and interface can be found
in `Verifier/src/main/java/com/intel/bkp/verifier/interfaces/VerifierExchange.java`.

Linux:

    java -cp sample-app.jar:Verifier.jar com.example.SampleApp ...

Windows:

    java -cp "Verifier.jar;sample-app.jar" com.example.SampleApp ...

## Comparison to CoRIM file (Concise Reference Integrity Manifest)

Verifier iterates over each block of CoRIM file and checks whether
all expected data is present in response from device, i.e.:

- in measurement response and certificate chain for Agilex.

## CoRIM local file support

Verifier is capable to use CoRIM unsigned files with `accept-unsigned-corim` flag set to `true`.
It's possible to use local paths in CoRIM for CoRIM and XCoRIM.

## Logs

Application logs are presented in the console output and saved to file:

    ./log/workload.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log

By default `INFO` level is set. To change it to more detailed add
parameter `--log-level` when running Workload:

    java workload.jar (…) --log-level TRACE

All possible options are presented when called without any parameters:

    OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE

## Configuration - config.properties

Configuration file `config.properties` contains parameters that will be parsed by Verifier, not the workload sample app.

## Signing Key rotation

During first run or when Verifier Signing Key needs to be rotated, clear the `verifier-key-params.key-name`
from `config.properties`.
In next run, a new key will be created, follow the instruction in the log to complete the process.

Additionally, you may clear the `verifier-key-params.verifier-root-qky-chain.multi-chain-path`
parameter. If not cleared, during next run the existing files in those locations will be backed up with a new name:

    existing_chain.qky.backup_<timestamp_millis>_<random_hex_value>

e.g.,

    existing_chain.qky.backup_9918285401_AABBCCDD
